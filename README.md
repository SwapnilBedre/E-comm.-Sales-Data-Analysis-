# E-comm.-Sales-Data-Analysis-
In this project, we analyze and visualize sales data. There are two CSV files: `Details` and `Orders`. 
- The `Details` file contains the following columns: Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, and Payment Mode.
- The `Orders` file contains the following columns: Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, State, and City.
Using the data from these files, I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
